# My-Favorite-Ahk-Scripts-for-Windows-10
My ahk scripts i use everyday.

+ #### back.ahk
> Browser previous page, when you double hit left arrow key, it sends event `alt + left key`, therefore modern browsers go previous page.I restricted it to browser only otherwise it writes `<` when jumping between chars in atom for example. In my case browser is called `"browser.exe"` because I use yandex browser, for chrome you must change it to `"chrome.exe"`
---
+ ### cap.ahk
> it simply opens a path by a key combination. In this case its my facebook messenger app called `"caprine.exe"`  and combination is `windows + F`
---

+ ### copy.ahk
> this script is a little weird, when `left mouse mouse button held down + c` key is pressed it beeps and sends `control + c`, I wrote this because sometimes I copy paste a lot and I dont want to press `control` with my little finger. _see paste.ahk below_

---
+ ### dbright.ahk
> This is most complicated one to use, although I can navigate with this without keyboard. When `right mouse` is clicked and hold it waits it to release. If you hold `left mouse` and release `right mouse` it sends `windows + tab` event. Therefore it reveals all windows and desktops for you to choose.
---

+ ### dbspace.ahk
>Its combination of `left alt + space` keys. When pressed sends `windows + tab` event for window and desktop selection.
---
+ ### esc.ahk
> This is the one of my favorites. When `esc` double pressed, it sends `alt + f4` event and closes the current window.

+ ### forward.ahk
> It makes the other part of _back.ahk_.
---
+ ### hide.ahk
> this is a copy paste from somewhere. It supposed to show and hide hidden folders in explorer but it doesn't work, I dont know why I kept it.
---
+ ### numlock.ahk
> This is another of my favorites. You hate not knowing what will happen when you hit a number from numpad? I do. This one is a copy paste code and disables `numlock` beautifully. 
---
+ ### paste.ahk
> This is other part of _copy.ahk_.
---
+ ### switch.ahk
> This is most essential script for using multiple desktops. When you hit `right control + arrow` keys, it sends `control + windows + arrow` keys. Therefore with one hand it is possible to switch desktops quickly.
